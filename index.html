<h1>Welcome to AIxPA 2022</h1>
AIxPA is a workshop born to provide a broad overview of recent activities in the field of e-procurement and e-tendering in Italy and provide participants a forum to share their ideas and make them grow.

Public procurement in general, and innovation procurement in particular, is a strategic tool at the disposal of economic development policies and represents a powerful instrument for the investment of public funds. The EUâ€™s 2021-2027 long-term budget and NextGenerationEU Initiative have allocated 82.47 billion to Public Administrations. Artificial Intelligence technologies represent a new frontier for development and growth in this framework. The use of AI by public administrations is growing, and AI technologies could significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public administrations. AI is becoming a more mature, and public administrations are reflecting on how to move beyond pilots and adopt AI solutions in their daily activities.
The potential benefits of AI technologies for the public sector are massive, but they are accompanied by serious risks that must be avoided. The use of AI within government comes with additional ethical considerations due to its unique role, legal status, and expectations compared with the private sector.
Indeed, several  research areas can be involved in this domain of applications, e.g.:


- Knowledge representation
- Automated reasoning
- Common sense reasoning
- Planning and Scheduling
- Searching
- Optimization
- Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Multi-Agent systems
- Robotics and Automation
- Connected and Automated vehicles
- AI Services
- AI Ethics
- AI Philosophy
