### What can Machine Learning do for the public procurement?  
*by Rosa Meo, Roberto Nai and Paolo Pasteris*
#### Abstract
We present the systematic work we conducted on the data about public procurement in Italy. The goal is to clean and integrate various public and open information sources and extract valuable information for the public sector and the companies interested in awarding a contract with the Public Administration. Included in the data analysis is the Regional Administrative Justice  that receives recourses from the involved actors.  This information coming from recourses is potentially useful for revealing some of the anomalies related to the incorrect behaviour of  the partners. The obtained results can also make lighter the administrative judges' workload.
#### Rosa Meo's Bio
Rosa Meo is associate professor in Computer Science ate University of Torino. Her research area is in the field of Data Mining, Machine Learning and NLP. She is active in the main conference program committees and journal editorial boards related to Data Mining. The work presented is the result of an active collaboration with prof. Gabriella Racca (Administrative Law) and ANAC (Italian National Authority Anti Corruption).
