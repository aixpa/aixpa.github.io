### What can Machine Learning do for the public procurement?  
*by Rosa Meo, Roberto Nai and Paolo Pasteris*
#### Abstract
We present the systematic work we conducted on the data about public procurement in Italy. The goal is to clean and integrate various public and open information sources and extract valuable information for the public sector and the companies interested in awarding a contract with the Public Administration. Included in the data analysis is the Regional Administrative Justice  that receives recourses from the involved actors.  This information coming from recourses is potentially useful for revealing some of the anomalies related to the incorrect behaviour of  the partners. The obtained results can also make lighter the administrative judges' workload.
#### Rosa Meo's Bio
Rosa Meo is associate professor in Computer Science ate University of Torino. Her research area is in the field of Data Mining, Machine Learning and NLP. She is active in the main conference program committees and journal editorial boards related to Data Mining. The work presented is the result of an active collaboration with prof. Gabriella Racca (Administrative Law) and ANAC (Italian National Authority Anti Corruption).

### Artificial Intelligence and Public Procurement: Pilot Applications for the Apulia Regional Central Purchasing Body
*by Monica Messa, Marco Di Ciano, Giuseppe Marziale, Nicola Lopane, Antonio Scaramuzzi*
### Abstract
We present the research work and the prototype experiments we have conducted with the aim of providing new AI instruments to support tender management and administrative observatory of public contracts within the regulatory framework of the public administration sector for the implementation of public procurement. With this purpose we have studied and tested AI techniques of Relational and Distributional Semantics, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Information extraction, Information Filtering,Recommender Systems, etc., to create a "passport" for economic operators taking part to a tender for work, services and goods in the field of public procurement applications and for the analysis of textual documents and automatic extraction of knowledge from different databases. 
### Monica Messa's Bio
Monica Messa is project manager for public administration applications and tenders at the regional central purchasing body. The work presented is the result of an active collaboration with the University of Bari and with the Regional Observatory of Public Contracts at the Apulia Region.
